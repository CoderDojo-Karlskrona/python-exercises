When you are courting a nice girl an hour seems like a second
When you sit on a red-hot cinder a second seems like an hour 
That's relativity.
--Albert Einstein

Logic will get you from A to B
Imagination will take you everywhere
--Albert Einstein

The mind is everything
What you think you become
--Buddha
